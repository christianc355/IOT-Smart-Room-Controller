# IOT-Smart-Room-Controller
This project was created as part of an IoT Bootcamp and CNM Ingenuity. The device is built on a Teensy 3.1 microcontroller and coded using the Arduino IDE. The smart room controller can read the rooms environment using a BME280 sensor. It can control the color and brightness of smart Phillips Hue lightbulbs, and also turn on and off internet connected Wemo power outlets. For the hard of hearing, this device includes a visual alarm clock that will flash Phillips Hue lightbulbs when it is time to wake up. It also uses a microphone and the same Phillips Hue lightbulbs to show a visual alert when someone is knocks at the door.
